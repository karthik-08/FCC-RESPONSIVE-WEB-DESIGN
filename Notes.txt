1. Html elements have opening and closing tags like <h1>…</h1>.
2. And the text always goes in between these tags.
3. The `h1` through `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements. Only use one `h1` element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.
